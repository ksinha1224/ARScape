# ARScape
A small mobile game demonstrating how AR technologies could be used to create mobile AR escape rooms.

This demo was created as part of my master's thesis and is not perfect by any means. There are many bugs and design issues
that would need to be worked out to make this a fully functional escape room game. Nonetheless, I have made all of the code
and assets available so that anyone can take a look at them.

ARScape uses Vuforia Studio to handle all of the augmented reality content placing in virtual space, so this project will not
run without a developer's license. Fortunately, that is free to obtain. https://developer.vuforia.com/ has more information
on obtaining a license. 

As part of my thesis, I wrote a paper that accompanies this game about the design and potential applications of a mobile 
augmented reality escape room. It can be found for free, along with verion two of the build for the game, at this 
Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gf6R_F9OChRK6nwydMSRJqjhaimAVGjm?usp=sharing

Note that the game only runs on Android devices.
